Hello everyone, I am John Roderix Dimayuga BSIT-B2. In assignment the task that I make is to make  enhancements to this code from my professor’s code, which is Guessing game. In this game I add some features  to the code such as User/Client, Game Difficulties from Easy to Hard and I add a Scoring system. He also required the serve to capture/save the users name and score of the chosen difficulty. I’m not a professional programmer but I did by best to finish this code and I watch some tutorial to make this code. To run this code you will need to to run the server on VS code and run the client on cmd. This will br my submission on lab assignment, and my submission for enhancing the Guessing game using socket.	
Enjoy, and have fun using this code Thank you.
